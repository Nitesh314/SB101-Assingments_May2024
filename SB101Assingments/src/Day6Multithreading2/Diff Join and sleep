Q5/- What is the Difference between the sleep and join method .

The `sleep()` and `join()` methods are both used in multithreading, but they serve
 different purposes:

1. **sleep() Method:**
   - The `sleep()` method is used to pause the execution of the current thread for
      a specified amount of time.
   - It takes a single argument, which is the duration of time to sleep in 
     milliseconds.
   - The thread that calls `sleep()` gives up its CPU time slice voluntarily for 
     the specified duration.
   - After the sleep duration elapses, the thread becomes eligible to run again, 
     but it's up to the scheduler to decide when it actually resumes execution.

2. **join() Method:**
   - The `join()` method is used to wait for the completion of another thread 
     before proceeding with the current thread.
   - It's typically used when one thread needs the results of another thread's 
     execution or when the threads need to synchronize their execution.
   - When a thread calls `join()` on another thread, it blocks until the joined 
     thread finishes its execution.
   - It's possible to specify a timeout in the `join()` method, allowing the 
     waiting thread to proceed after a certain period even if the joined thread 
     hasn't finished.

In summary, `sleep()` is used to introduce a delay in the execution of a single 
thread, while `join()` is used to coordinate the execution of multiple threads by 
waiting for one thread to complete before proceeding with another.
