Q4/- What is a Race condition, How will you solve the Race condition,explain with an
Example


A race condition in programming occurs when the outcome of a program depends on 
the timing or order of execution of concurrent threads or processes. It typically
happens when multiple threads or processes access shared data or resources without
proper synchronization. To solve a race condition, synchronization mechanisms 
like locks, mutexes, or semaphores are employed to ensure that only one thread 
can access the shared resource at a time, thus preventing conflicts and ensuring
consistency.
