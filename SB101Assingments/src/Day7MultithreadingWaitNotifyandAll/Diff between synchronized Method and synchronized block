Q1/ What is the difference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block?

synchronized method=> 
                   1 When a method is declared as synchronized, it means that the 
                     entire method is synchronized.
                     
				   2 Only one thread can execute the synchronized method at a time,
				     regardless of which part of the method the thread is executing.
					
				   3 This provides simplicity, as the synchronization is applied to
				     the entire method automatically.
					   
synchronized block=>  
                    1 In contrast, a synchronized block allows you to specify a 
                      specific section of code to be synchronized.
                      
					2 This gives more flexibility, as only the specified block of 
					  code within the method is synchronized, rather than the entire
					  method.
					  
					3 It allows for finer-grained control over synchronization and 
					  can improve performance in some cases, as it reduces the 
					  scope of the lock.
