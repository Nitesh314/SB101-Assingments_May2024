Q2/ What is the Difference between the wait and sleep methods?


wait=>
      1 wait method belong to object class
      2 using wait we get accurate position of stop or suspend the program 
      3 in wait we can use the time to suspend program of sum accurate time also
      4 wait method is always use in synchronized area.
      5 if we use wait then it is mandatory to use notify.
      
      
sleep=>
        1 sleep method belong to Thread class
        2 using sleep we can suspend the thread for sum specific time.      
        3 using sleep the program can get the less time to compile and it is happen 
          also increase the time of compiling 
          that why if it get less time then remaning time will waist.
          if it get more time then we get problem
