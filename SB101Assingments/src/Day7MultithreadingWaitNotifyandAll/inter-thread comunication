Inter-thread Communication:

wait(): A thread that calls wait() on an object releases the lock and enters the waiting state until another thread calls notify() or notifyAll() on the same object.
notify(): Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on the object's monitor.
notifyAll(): Wakes up all threads that are waiting on the object's monitor.
