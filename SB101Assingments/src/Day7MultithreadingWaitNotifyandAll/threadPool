Q5/ What is a ThreadPool, how to create a thread pool of 4 threads, and write
down the difference between the Callable and Runnable interface.

ThreadPool=> 
           it is a collections of threads ,here we know that creating a Thread it 
           is  a very costly resources there for the java people introduces
           ThreadPool in java 105 version
           in this we can create multiple thread and we can reuse this thread in our
           program once they complete there task successfully... 
  
  
  creating the ThreadPool of four Thread.
  
           ExecutorService ex=Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
           
           
  difference between the Callable and Runnable interface
  
 Callable=>
           Callable belong to util.concurrent package.
           Callable has a only one abstract method  Object<> call() throw Exception;
           callable has a return type.
           callable using for ThreadPool related operations. 
 Runnable=>
            Runnable belong to lang package
            runnable has a only one abstract method void run();
            runnable is use both Thread and ThreadPool also.
