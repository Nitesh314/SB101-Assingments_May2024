Q1/- Explain the meaning of the deadlock in multithreaded application, when it can occur in
multithreading applications.Write one example of deadlock.

Deadlock=>
         in multithreading the deadlock position means the program is dead.
         here the deadlock occur when the two synchronized program can contains each other property
         then the deadlock position occur. because the both can have a unique lock
         but if they can called each one method or program than they can combine each other
         and the thread not release the lock then we get a deadlock position
         
         to avoid the deadlock position we can remove one side of synchronized function or program ..
         
         
         Example in  Main1 class.
