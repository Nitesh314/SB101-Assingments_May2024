What is the difference between Statement and PreparedStatement?

1=>Statement
  
   1: it is Used for executing static SQL queries, where the SQL command is 
       hardcoded directly into the Java code.
       
   2:Vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it directly incorporates user
     inputs into the SQL query. 
   
   3:SQL queries are not precompiled, which means each query is parsed and executed
     separately. This can be slower for repeated queries. 
     
   4:Typically used for executing a single SQL query. Not designed for repeated use with
     different parameters.
   
   5:Simpler for executing static SQL queries. Less boilerplate code.   
   
   6:Use Statement for simple, static queries where SQL injection is not a concern.


2=>PreparedStatement

   1:Used for executing dynamic or parameterized SQL queries, where the SQL command is 
     precompiled and parameters can be set dynamically.   
     
   2:Helps prevent SQL injection by separating the SQL logic from the data. Parameters 
     are bound to the query separately, making it safer. 
     
   3:SQL queries are precompiled by the database, allowing for faster execution, especially 
      when the same query is executed multiple times with different parameters.
      
   4:Designed for repeated execution with different parameters. Ideal for batch processing 
      and executing the same query multiple times.   
      
   5:More verbose due to parameter setting, but provides 
     better flexibility and security.      
     
   6:Use PreparedStatement for dynamic queries, especially when dealing with user inputs, 
     to prevent SQL injection and improve performance.
